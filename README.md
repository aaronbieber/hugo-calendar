# Hugo Calendar

If you post sporadically on a Hugo-generated blog and you want to see a
visualization of when you have posted through the months, this is the project
for you.

Build using the command in the `justfile` and run `hugo-calendar` to see the
options and arguments. Run from a Hugo project with the appropriate flags to
get a visual calendar output in your terminal.

Claude wrote most of this code for me so don't come after me if it doesn't
work.
